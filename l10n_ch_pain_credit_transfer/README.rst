=======================================
Switzerland - ISO 20022 credit transfer
=======================================

This module adds support for *pain.001.001.03.ch.02* which is used for ISO 20022 credit transfers in Switzerland (SEPA or not SEPA).

It implements the guidelines for `ISO 20022 credit transfers <http://www.six-interbank-clearing.com/dam/downloads/fr/standardization/iso/swiss-recommendations/implementation_guidelines_ct.pdf>`_ published by SIX Interbank Clearing.

Configuration
=============

In the menu *Accounting > Configuration > Management > Payment Methods*,
select the payment method that has the code *sepa_credit_transfer* and
set the *PAIN Version* to *pain.001.001.03.ch.02 (credit transfer in Switzerland)*.

Usage
=====

On the payment order, you will see a new computed boolean field named
*ISR* which shows if the payment order is BVR or not.

This module doesn't modify the standard usage of the modules
*account_payment_order* and *account_banking_sepa_credit_transfer*.
