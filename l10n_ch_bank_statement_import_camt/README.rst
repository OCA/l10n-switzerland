Usage
=====

Journals can be defined as "QR IBAN for import" which modify the way the import will behave.
If this is marked it will search for a bank account with a l10n_ch_qr_iban corresponding to the second IBAN available in the camt (Ntry/NtryRef xml tag).
This allow to have a bank account set on two different journals and use the QRR swiss functionality to import on his own specific journal the referenced transactions.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Known issues:

* Currently this module has a problem with the manual import (Specific import button on each journal) when two journals are set with the same bank account. This is because the match journal check that the context journal is equal to the one matched, it matches the first journal with the IBAN found in the file. The general import button does work.
