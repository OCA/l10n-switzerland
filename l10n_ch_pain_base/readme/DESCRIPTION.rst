This module doesn't do anything by himself. It is the base module for 2 other modules:

* the module *l10n_ch_pain_credit_transfer* which adds support for the file format *pain.001.001.03.ch.02* which is used for ISO 20022 credit transfers (SEPA or not SEPA),
* the module *l10n_ch_pain_direct_debit* which adds support for the file format *pain.008.001.02.ch.01* which is used for ISO 20022 direct debits.
