LSV and Postfinance Direct Debit file generator
===============================================
Features:
---------
    * LSV file generation
    * Postfinance Direct Debit file generation
    * Invoice freeing. You can "free" an invoice that is in a direct debit \
    order. This is because you have sometimes to generate 2 direct debit \
    order for the same invoice (i.e. if debit fails the first time).


Prerequisite for LSV file generation:
-------------------------------------
For LSV file generation, don't forget :
    * To set your LSV identifier in your beneficiary bank account.
    * To set your BVR identifier in your beneficiary bank account if you want \
    to use BVR references.
    * To setup a payment mode with payment type "LSV Direct Debit"
    * That each partner which is concerned by LSV has to have a valid bank \
    account with a valid mandate.

Prerequisite for Postfiance Direct Debit file generation:
---------------------------------------------------------
For postfinance DD file generation, don't forget :
    * To set your Postfinance DD identifier in your beneficiary BVR account.
    * To setup a payment mode with payment type "Postfinance Direct Debit"
    * That each partner which is concerned by Postfinance DD has to have a \
    valid BV account with a valid mandate.

Standard workflow:
------------------
    * Create some invoices for partners with well configured bank accounts.
    * Create a Direct Debit order with a payment mode having LSV/DD payment \
    type.
    * Make sure that due dates are in the valid range if you chose "Due date" \
    as preferred execution date.
    * Press "Confirm payments"
    * Press "Make payments". This will launch the LSV/DD file generation \
    wizard.
    * Download the generated file and press "Validate". If you need to \
    download the file again, you can access the generated file with the \
    "Generated Direct Debit Files" menu.

Currently, only BVR reference usage is implemented (using l10n_ch_payment_slip
 module) for LSV refernece. IPI usage is not implemented yet, this way an
 error occurs if no BVR ref are set in invoices.

This module uses the framework provided by the banking addons, cf
