In order to be able to use the module, you need to have a Postfinance FDS
Account. You can generate authentication key pairs for your users (to allow
them using the service) from the module.

To generate a new private key in the database, you need to launch odoo with
the option --ssh_pwd=your_password or add it to your config file:
ssh_pwd = your_password
