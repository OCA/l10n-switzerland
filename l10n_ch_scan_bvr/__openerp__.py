{"name": "Wizard to Scan BVR for Invoice",
 "description": """
create invoices from BVR code

This module works with C-channel or other OCR scanner.

It helps you to create an invoice directly from the BVR Code. Find the menu entry
called "Scan BVR" under Accounting -> Supplier. It open a popup from which you
can scan the BVR number. It'll recognize the needed information and create an 
invoice for the right supplier.

If you have completed the field "Default product supplier invoice" on the concerned
supplier, it'll create a line with the proper amount and the given product.

It currently supports BVR and BVR+
