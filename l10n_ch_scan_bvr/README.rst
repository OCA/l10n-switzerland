Scan ESR/BVR to create supplier invoices
========================================

This module works with C-channel or other OCR scanner.

It helps you to create an invoice directly from the ESR/BVR Code.
Find the menu entry called "Scan BVR" under Accounting -> Supplier.
It open a popup from which you can scan the ESR/BVR number.
It'll recognize the needed information and create an
invoice for the right supplier.

If you have completed the field "Default product supplier invoice"
on the concerned supplier,
it'll create a line with the proper amount and the given product.

It currently supports BVR and BVR+
