To import your invoices Launch the wizard `Invoicing` -> `Vendors` -> `Import Vendor Bill`.

In there you can either directly the QR code of the QR-bill or you can import a PDF/image file.

If it's the first time you import a Bill from a Vendor the wizard will ask you to create the partner and to set a import configuration for that partner
A configuration let you set which expense account you want the invoice to be imported with.


To quickly import a serie of invoice, use the button `Import Next Invoice` from the Vendor bill form.
