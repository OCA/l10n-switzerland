Import Vendor bills with a PayEye scanner.

The QR bills are introduced in Switzerland since the 30th of June 2020.

**Table of contents**

Installation
============

This module depends on `account_invoice_import` which is located in `edi` and has dependencies on `community-data-files`.
So the repositories `edi` and `community-data-files` must be present on the system.

Optionally you can also import Vendor bills directly from a PDF.
To enable this feature those additional dependencies must be
installed on your Odoo server:

    pip install pyzbar,numpy,pdf2image,opencv-python-headless

If you are looking to generate QR-bill, this feature is already available
in Odoo in the Switzerland localization module (`l10n_ch`).

Configuration
=============

In order to configure the type of invoice created per partner.

Make sure your os have these package:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils libzbar0


Got to:
  - `Accounting` or `Invoicing`
  - `Configuration`
  - `Import Vendor Bill`
  - `Import Bills`

you will find the configuration of each partner.


In order to automatically create bank accounts on QR-bill import:

Go to:

  - `Accounting` or `Invoicing`
  - `Configuration`
  - `Settings`
  - `Invoice Import`

And activate `Auto-create Bank`

Usage
=====

To import your invoices Launch the wizard `Invoicing` -> `Vendors` -> `Import Vendor Bill`.

In there you can either directly the QR code of the QR-bill or you can import a PDF/image file.

If it's the first time you import a Bill from a Vendor the wizard will ask you to create the partner and to set an import configuration for that partner.
A configuration let you set which expense account you want the invoice to be imported with.


To quickly import a series of invoices, use the button `Import Next Invoice` from the Vendor bill form.

TODO:

- Read the Swico standard from Billing info
