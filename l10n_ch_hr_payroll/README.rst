** Remarks: **
    * To prevent overwriting your salary rules changes, an update from 1.0.8 and lower to 1.0.9 and higher creates duplicates of the salary rules. This is because with some migrated databases, one may encounter a difficulty with the existing rules (they can not be erased if they are already used). The solution is then to force the existing ones to be non-updatable. And this is done using an included pre-migration script.
    * As this module proposes its own report (same as the original, but with its own footer), don't forget to make it non-updatable.
