To Do

* The B2C invoice generated id only a draft and not tested, yet.
* Implementation of the automatic registration of contracts, is not impemented and probably not supported by the DWS

Improvements

* On the contract view the list of messages for that contract could be visible.
* When an error is returned by the service it should be clearer where it is located in the payload send.
* In the chatter add a link to the job when it fails
