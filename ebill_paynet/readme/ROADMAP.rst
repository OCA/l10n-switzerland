To Do

* The invoices send to a B2C configured service have not been tested, yet.
* Implementation of the automatic registration of contracts, need to be implemented.
* Allow for multiple services, so need to implement the password differently.

Improvements

As the registration for paynet requires an IBAN account number. The configuration of the service on Odoo should also allow to select an account.and this account should be selected automatically for a new invoice to be send to paynet.

On the contract view the list of messages for that contract should be visible.

When an error is returned by the service it should be clearer where it is located in the payload send.
